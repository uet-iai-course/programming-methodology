**Task:** Redraw the uploaded flowchart into a clearer, slide-ready diagram for first-year programming students, using a clean whiteboard hand-drawn style. Translate labels to Vietnamese and keep the original English as secondary text in parentheses.

**Must keep (logic integrity):**

1. Preserve the **exact algorithmic logic** of the original: same decisions, same True/False outcomes, same loop behavior, and same overall input/output meaning.
2. You **may** re-layout and reorganize the diagram for clarity (spacing, alignment, grouping), but **must not change** the meaning or control flow.
3. Do not introduce new decision points that change behavior. If you add details, they must be **purely explanatory** (annotations), not functional changes.

**Allowed enhancements (for better intuition):**

* Add **short Vietnamese annotations** near key steps (e.g., “Cập nhật biến”, “Lặp lại đến khi…”, “Kiểm tra điều kiện”).
* Add **simple icons** to improve comprehension (minimal line icons):
  input (keyboard), output (screen/printer), decision (question mark), loop (circular arrow), variable/update (tag/box), warning/error (small bug or exclamation).
  Icons must be small, consistent, and not distract from the flow.
* If presented in the original diagram:  Add **step numbers** (Bước 1, Bước 2, …) if it helps reading order.
* If presented in the original diagram: Add **branch labels** “Có/Không” (or “Đúng/Sai”) clearly on arrows.
* If the original text is long, rewrite into **shorter Vietnamese** while keeping meaning.

**Text rules (Vietnamese primary, English secondary):**

* For every node label, write **Vietnamese first (larger + bolder)** and then the **original English in parentheses** right after it in a **smaller, lighter** style, exactly matching the source English text.
* Keep variable names/code tokens unchanged (e.g., i, n, sum, x>0).
* Use consistent terms: “Bắt đầu (Start)”, “Kết thúc (End)”, “Nhập … (Input …)”, “Xuất/In … (Output/Print …)”, “Nếu …? (If …?)”.
* For this particular diagram, here are some suggested translations for common phrases:
  - Interpreter: Trình thông dịch
  - Compiler: Trình biên dịch
  - Sequence control: Điều khiển trình tự
  - Data control: Điều khiển dữ liệu
  - Memory management: Quản lý bộ nhớ
  - Memory: Bộ nhớ
  - Data: Dữ liệu
  - Program: Chương trình
  - Operations: Các phép toán
  - Runtime support (RTS): Hỗ trợ thực thi

**Style guide (clean whiteboard hand-drawn):**

* 16:9 canvas, generous margins for slides.
* White background, no gridlines.
* Hand-drawn style: simulate whiteboard marker look.
* Marker-like strokes, slightly imperfect but neat; uniform thickness.
* Shapes: rounded rectangles (process), diamonds (decision), consistent sizing.
* Arrows: bold, clear arrowheads; tidy routing; avoid overlaps.
* Colors: mostly dark ink (black/dark navy). One accent color (blue/green) for emphasis; red only for warnings or “Không/Sai” if needed.
* No 3D, no gradients, no heavy shadows, no glossy effects, no clutter.

**Output requirements:**

* Produce a single clean PNG diagram, high contrast and readable from a classroom projector.
* Ensure all text fits inside shapes; annotations/icons stay outside nodes or in margins.
